# Arta Internship
Internship Task:

At present, business plan samples posted on the external portal are added by making changes to the code, that is, when adding, changing and deleting a sample business plan, the developer has to manually update the code list of business plan samples.
Since such changes are made quite often, it is necessary to create the possibility for an external portal administrator, the Customerâ€™s representatives, to independently update the list of sample business plans.
The external portal uses the internal portal Synergy, through which the management of services is implemented. So the task is to implement the management of sample business plans through the internal portal.
Adding, modifying and deleting sample business plans should be implemented through the developed form in the Synergy configurator, which will later be used by the Synergy content manager, and the registry will be used to manage the business samples.
